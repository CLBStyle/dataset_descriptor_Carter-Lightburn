This dataset, in its broadest sense, covered Indian migration to different nations from 1960 to 2000. Structurally, the dataset is organized as a table in which each row corresponds to a single aggregated migration record, defined by a destination country (or region) and a specific year or time period, with associated numerical migration measures. This structure ensures the strictly quantitative structure of the dataset and omits the stories and sentiment amongst the native inhabitants of the host countries and the immigrants themselves. The dataset is additionally visually unappealing and difficult to read, making observations, connections or interpretations about the data difficult.  

The main author and researcher is Raja CSP, who appears to be ethnically Indian but lives in Toronto. He stated that he created the dataset with the intention of learning the countries that Indians prefer to immigrate to and wanted to explore the exact rise in Indian immigration. He also stated that he wanted the dataset to be used for education and analytics purposes only and not for the purpose of bigoted anger directed at Indian immigrants. He also took the data directly from the Global Migration Data of the World Bank. The Kaggle author simply is coding a second-hand transcription of a different dataset; there is no indication he consciously or unconsciously manipulated data or research for an ulterior motive or because of bias. However, the data inherits the structural limitations and biases of the original sources from which it was transcribed. 

The biggest issue with the data stems from the fact that it’s titled “Indian Immigration” and yet can’t possibly represent every Indian citizen who emigrated. The World Bank heavily draws their information from the UN and the national data collected by the host western nations (World Bank). This aspect of the data reveals a large flaw in the data presented. Government agencies cannot accurately calculate true immigration numbers. This is most obvious in the fact that undocumented immigration is not counted, and there is no indication if this is accounted for or not in the dataset. Some host nations have better census data than others; lack of funding and employees can lead to large-scale immigration being unaccounted for, even in the wealthier Western nations from whom the data is being calculated. Additionally, since census data is government funded, the government has the prerogative over every aspect of how and if that data is to be collected. Narratives reflecting immigration impact governance, which will determine funding and instruction for data collecting when it comes to immigration. This issue is exacerbated by the motives and the politics of the countries. For example, a country attempting to hide its true number of immigration to diminish certain groups or hide their electoral voting power from the public might try be less stringent in tabulating all arrivals, while a country that hopes to use immigration as a talking point might expend extra resources towards doing so. This combines with the aforementioned fact that the numbers of Indian emigration do not explain the motives for both host and visitor, the benefits and potential drawbacks of the increase in Indian emigration, and finally the treatment of Indian immigrants in their new countries.
